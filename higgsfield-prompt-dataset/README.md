# Higgsfield.ai Prompt & Preset Dataset

A systematic crawl of the public surface of **higgsfield.ai**, extracting every discoverable prompt
and pairing each one with the image or video it generated. Delivered as a narrative report, an
Excel/CSV dataset, a browsable HTML gallery, and a print-ready PDF.

## 1. What's here

Every record carries the full prompt text, a description of what it creates, the associated model or
motion effect, the source page URL — and **the asset it produced**. Open
[`assets/gallery.html`](assets/gallery.html) to browse prompts beside their results, or filter the
spreadsheet by model, style, or subject.

Thumbnails (512px WebP) are committed so the gallery and PDF work straight from a clone. The
full-resolution originals — roughly 8 GB of PNG and MP4 — are **not** in the repo; fetch them with:

```bash
python3 tools/download_assets.py                 # everything
python3 tools/download_assets.py --images-only   # stills only
python3 tools/download_assets.py --tool "Viral Preset"
```

## 2. How the site was mapped

`robots.txt` advertises eleven sitemaps, which enumerate 1,138 URLs. Three link-discovery passes over
the fetched HTML — following every internal `href` and diffing against what was already known — grew
that to **5,121 fetched pages**, including ~3,600 per-example sub-pages
(`/motion/<id>/<exampleId>`, `/viral-presets/examples/<slug>/<exampleId>`) that carry the individual
creator samples. The final discovery pass returned **zero** new pages, so the reachable public surface
is exhausted.

All 37 `Disallow` rules in `robots.txt` are parsed and enforced in code (`tools/crawl.py`), including
`/me/`, `/library/`, `/share/`, `/flow/`, `/soul/`, `/mixed-media-community/`, `/viral-presets/use/`
and the four non-English locale trees. Six concurrent workers, 150 ms delay, exponential backoff.
Nothing behind authentication was touched.

## 3. How prompts and assets were extracted

Higgsfield is a **TanStack Start** app. Each page inlines a server-rendered router payload — a
`$R[n]=…` object graph — that holds the real generation records behind every gallery tile. That
payload, not the rendered DOM, is the high-fidelity source. Seven extractors run over every page.
Counts below are *post-deduplication attribution* — several extractors legitimately find the same
prompt, and the merge keeps the richest record, so a low count means "usually superseded", not
"found nothing". (All 24 server-rendered Prompt Bank camera movements are in the dataset, for
instance; they simply merge into `flat_prompts.py` records.)

| Extractor | Reads | Records |
|---|---|---|
| `flat_prompts.py` | flat `prompt:"…"` records, incl. academy lesson `video_cues` with `recreate_url`, shot timestamps and lesson media | 1,460 |
| `catalog.py` | motion / viral / mixed-media preset pages: name, description, model, preview video + creator examples | 538 |
| `prose.py` | long `<p>`/`<pre>`/`<blockquote>` blocks in blog and academy articles, classifier-gated | 363 |
| `jobs.py` | nested `prompt:{prompt:"…"}` job records with `jobSetType`, preset, quality, aspect ratio, duration and the job's own `media:` block | 201 |
| `recreate.py` | `?recreate=<prompt>&model=<model>` hrefs behind "Recreate" buttons | 93 |
| `figures.py` | `<figcaption>` / `aria-label` on demo figures, plus platform/tier badges | 92 |
| `pbank.py` | the Academy Prompt Bank's `{title, prompt, categoryId, media}` records | 0 |

### Pairing each prompt to its asset

The `media_pairing` column records **how** each asset was matched, so weaker inferences can be
filtered out:

| Pairing method | Records |
|---|---|
| payload-proximity | 1402 |
| preset-preview | 538 |
| proximity | 331 |
| lesson | 181 |
| figure | 92 |

- **exact** / **preset-preview** — the asset came from the record's own `media:{rawUrl, source,
  thumbnail, width, height}` block or the preset's `<video>` preview. Unambiguous.
- **payload-proximity** / **proximity** — nearest media to the prompt inside the payload or the DOM.
  Right in the large majority of spot-checks, but inferred.
- **lesson** — the academy lesson video the prompt's shot appears in (with a timestamp).
- **figure** — the `<figure>` element the caption belongs to.

A shared filter (`tools/assetfilter.py`) rejects site furniture — profile avatars and banners,
country flags, logos, placeholder thumbnails — so decorative images aren't passed off as samples.

### Separating prompts from prose

Article bodies mix genuine prompts with marketing copy and how-to advice. A two-stage classifier
(`tools/prose.py`) resolves it: `looks_like_prompt()` requires length, word density, and either a
structural marker (`Format & Style:`, `Camera:`, `HEX VALUES:`) or ≥3 cinematographic terms;
`classify()` then weighs scene-opening grammar against second-person instructional markers.
For figure captions a page-frequency rule does the heavy lifting — a caption appearing on more than
three distinct pages is boilerplate, not a prompt.

Every record is graded **High / Medium / Low** confidence.
2,664 of 2,747 (97%) are High.

## 4. What the corpus looks like

### By tool type

| Tool type | Records |
|---|---|
| Motion Effect Prompt | 1231 |
| Motion Effect Preset | 442 |
| Video Generation | 351 |
| Editorial / Tutorial Prompt | 313 |
| Lesson / Course Prompt | 177 |
| Image Generation | 119 |
| Viral Preset | 63 |
| Mixed Media Preset | 33 |
| Marketing / Ad Generation | 6 |
| Audio / Voice | 4 |
| Cinema Studio | 4 |
| Viral Preset Prompt | 3 |
| Lipsync / Avatar | 1 |

### By model / motion engine

| Model | Records |
|---|---|
| Wan 2.5 | 1338 |
| MiniMax Hailuo | 131 |
| Seedance 2.0 | 118 |
| Higgsfield Soul 2.0 | 78 |
| Viral Preset (Higgsfield) | 62 |
| kling-v2-1 | 46 |
| Seedance 2.0 4K | 40 |
| Mixed Media | 33 |
| Seedance 2.5 | 31 |
| Kling 3.0 | 31 |
| kling-v2-1-master | 29 |
| Sora 2 | 28 |
| seedance_pro | 25 |
| Nano Banana Pro | 22 |
| Cinema Studio | 18 |
| Higgsfield Soul (Cinematic) | 18 |

598 records carry no attributable model — mostly
model-agnostic blog and academy pages. Where the URL or a `recreate_url` names one it is used;
otherwise the field is left empty rather than guessed.

### By generation style (multi-label)

| Style | Records |
|---|---|
| Cinematic / Film | 672 |
| Product / Commercial | 640 |
| Glitch / Experimental | 408 |
| Photorealistic | 260 |
| UGC / Handheld | 214 |
| Fashion / Editorial | 186 |
| Retro / VHS / Analog | 161 |
| Fantasy / Sci-Fi | 143 |
| Noir / Moody | 120 |
| Horror / Thriller | 97 |
| Aerial / Drone | 93 |
| 3D / CGI Render | 89 |

### By visual subject (multi-label)

| Subject | Records |
|---|---|
| People / Portrait | 2310 |
| Architecture / Interior | 881 |
| Landscape / Nature | 792 |
| Abstract / Texture | 699 |
| Product / Object | 474 |
| Vehicles / Transport | 378 |
| Food / Drink | 263 |
| Animals / Creatures | 251 |
| Text / Logo / Graphic | 198 |

### By prompt length

| Words | Prompts |
|---|---|
| 1–25 | 311 |
| 26–75 | 516 |
| 76–200 | 1078 |
| 201–500 | 166 |
| 500+ | 138 |

The bimodality is deliberate — Higgsfield's own Sora 2 guide teaches "two formulas": short
high-signal prompts that let the model direct, and high-control prompts specifying every shot. The
longest record is a 3,282-word Seedance scene breakdown using `@character` reference tokens
across a full multi-shot sequence.

---

## 5. Observed prompt conventions

Patterns that recur across the high-fidelity records:

- **Shot-first grammar.** Prompts open by naming the shot, not the subject: *"A low-angle full-body
  shot captures…"*, *"Head-tracking flight shot of a peregrine falcon."*
- **Labelled blocks for long prompts** — `Format & Style:`, `Camera:`, `Lens:`, `Main Subject(s):`,
  `Wardrobe and Props`, `Lighting & Palette`, `Actions & Camera Beats (0–12 s)`, `Dialogue (full)`,
  `Sound & Foley`, `Montage Plan`.
- **Timecoded beats.** `• 0–4 s — …`, `[0–2s] – CUT 1 / OPEN.`
- **Palette pinning via hex.** Soul image prompts append a literal `HEX VALUES: ["#1c3633", …]`
  array — typically 15 colours — to lock the grade.
- **Bracketed slots.** Prompt Bank camera moves are templates: *"…starting on [composition A] and
  sweeping across [the environment]…"* — the move stays separate from the scene so it survives a
  frame swap.
- **Negative constraints.** *"no sideways travel, no dolly, no truck, no arc, no slide, no zoom,
  no tilt."*
- **Reference tokens.** `@truck1`, `@woman`, `@fantasy-dragon`, `<<<video_1>>>`, `<<<image_1>>>`.

## 7. Reproducing

```bash
cd tools
python3 crawl.py all_urls.txt      # fetch corpus        -> pages/
python3 discover.py                # link discovery
python3 master.py                  # 7 extractors        -> raw_rows.jsonl
python3 clean.py                   # dedupe + categorise -> dataset.json
python3 assets.py --width 512 --max-extra 4   # manifest + thumbnails
python3 build_gallery.py && python3 build_csv.py && python3 build_xlsx.py && python3 build_pdf.py
python3 verify.py                  # end-to-end checks
```

Crawl and extraction use only the standard library; `openpyxl`, `reportlab` and `Pillow` are needed
for the Excel, PDF and thumbnail-validation steps.

## 8. Known limitations

Stated plainly rather than papered over:

1. **The headless browser cannot reach this site from the build sandbox.** Chromium and Playwright
   are installed and correctly configured, but every navigation to higgsfield.ai fails with
   `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` — the sandbox's egress proxy closes the browser's tunnels mid-exchange
   (`ws_closed_mid_exchange`) while plain `curl` on the same URL succeeds. Verified repeatedly with
   proxy args, `--ignore-certificate-errors`, and HTTP/2 and QUIC disabled. Mining the SSR payload is
   the workaround, and it recovers strictly more structured data than scraping a rendered DOM would.
2. **Client-side paginated tails are unreachable.** The TanStack server-function endpoint
   (`TSS_SERVER_FN_BASE = "/_serverFn/"`, SHA-256 ids) returns **404** to direct GET and POST calls.
   So the Academy Prompt Bank yields 24 of its 46 camera movements, and community feeds yield only
   the server-rendered slice (78 of a
   reported 148 for `soul-community`). `?category=` and `?section=` query variants do not change the
   SSR slice.
3. **Seedance 2.5's community feed ships no prompt text in SSR** — only `jobId` and media, with
   prompts fetched per item client-side.
4. **Proximity-paired assets are inferences.** 1,733
   records were matched by nearest-media rather than an explicit link. Spot-checks were overwhelmingly
   correct, but filter on `media_pairing` if you need only exact pairs.
5. **Mixed-media presets have boilerplate descriptions.** The site serves a generic string for them;
   it is nulled out rather than presented as a real description.
6. **125 records have no asset** — chiefly article prompts with no nearby image.

## 9. Provenance

Retrieved from publicly accessible pages on higgsfield.ai on 2026-09-04, honouring `robots.txt`.
Prompt text, preset names, effect descriptions and generated media are Higgsfield's and their
creators'; this is a structured index of public material assembled for research and analysis.
Community prompts and their samples were authored by the site's users and appear on public community
pages. Thumbnails are reduced-resolution copies included for identification; full-resolution
originals are deliberately not redistributed here.
